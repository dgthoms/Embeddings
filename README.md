# Embeddings
A repository for some files related to embeddings


## Getting started
For basic usage, you can simply 

* pip install hdbscan

* pip install umap-learn

There may be some issues with pip installing in Windows (I exclusively use linux for dev work). If you use Windows and run into any issues please let me know.

## Getting started - advanced

HDBSCAN is a fairly static implementation at the moment. UMAP is being more actively developed. 

For some more modern things (interactive viz), try the experimental branch (which is quite near to becoming the master!)

* pip install datashader
* pip install holoviews
* pip install git+https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap@0.4dev
